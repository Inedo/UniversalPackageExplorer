# Universal Package Explorer: A Community Project

The Universal Package Explorer is a Windows desktop application that makes it easy to create, view, and publish universal packages. You can load a .upack file from disk, or directly from a ProGet universal feed.

## Community Project

The Universal Package Explorer was originally developed by an Inedo user, and we've since "adopted" it into our own open-source projects. Although it's a bit buggy, we're happy to accept pull requests/fixes for this tool. See the [Contributing](https://inedo.com/open/contributing) section on the Inedo website to learn more.

As much as we love the concept of project, there aren't whole lot of users for this tool, and it's unlikely we'll be able to invest any real development resources into this project in the near future. We have a lot of other projects and ideas that can  bring a lot more value to our users, so we will focus on time on those for now.

To be honest, we're not even sure about the value that this project brings, especially when you can easily use ProGet's web interface to browse packages and use a zip tool (like the free 7zip) to edit/view package file contents. If you've got ideas for usecases for this tool, please let us know - that might just change our mind about investing resources :)
